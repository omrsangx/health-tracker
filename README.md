# Sleep Tracker

This is a web application using Flask and Python3 (with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that tracks your sleep pattern. All the data that is collected is manually entered by yuou and locally stored in a SQLite3 database/file. You can configure the database of your chooese, but some changes need to be done.

The goal of this project is to keep adding different components, such as daily activities, heart beats, and so on, that will be combined to analyze the sleep patterns.

The app is tracking quality, quantity, and duration, and among other things (these other things, at the moment, are not being used).
